This is a simple terminal program which keeps being helpful to me.
It can give you basic typing on a serial port, knows how to invoke
x- y- and z-modem programs within it, and can also do session capture.

See the LICENSE.  I will be very surprised if its terms keep you from
using this little bit of code.
